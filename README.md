Graph-based structures are being increasingly used to model data and relations among data in a number of fields. Graph-based databases are becoming more popular as a means to better represent such data. Graph traversal is a key component in graph algorithms such as reachability and graph matching. Since the scale of data stored and queried in these databases is increasing, it is important to obtain high performing implementations of graph traversal that can efficiently utilize the processing power of modern processors.  In this work, we present a scalable Breadth-First Search Traversal, Depth First traversal algorithm, MST using kruskal & Prims algorithm, Single source shortest path using dijskra and Bellmen ford algorithm for modern multi-socket, multi-core CPUs.
